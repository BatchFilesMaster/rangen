# Rangen
1 million characters, 22 lines of code.

That’s the smallest program—and one of the smallest ever written—that runs in Python.

It also runs on the Raspberry Pi 3.

That might not sound like much, but it means a million characters can be written in 22 lines of code, in any programming language, on any hardware platform.

As you can see from the code itself, written by my friend Petri Kokko, the approach is simple: an array of characters are compared, and if they are similar, “save” them to an array. Repeat this for every possible combination of letters and numbers, then “save” the array and repeat.

The idea is that you can easily adjust the list of items that were “saved” to the end of the program, in the “insertion” function, if you want to. (Insertions are generally special because they do something else than writing characters to a file.)

# Epicness
Yes, 1 million.
Far beyond our 1k, hand typed through a week

With 30+ colors for detail

Yes, that is a million word count to a document.

It was a longer task than I anticipated as the task was multiple files and all types, due to size, and in a pdf format. No exceptions.

In short, it took 6 hours. Some of the files were small, but I had to break it down into each section.

In fact, it was a good example of what I should have done in the beginning.

# Installation
Step 1: Make sure python is installed to PATH

Step 2: Double click "App.py" and go forth!
# Notes 
This will effect your storage for the 2 seconds it generates, we use a single file to output. Do not use if you have under 1 gegabyte

Librarys used and what they were used for:

# Random

Used for choosing a digit 0 - 82 for characters 

# Time

Used for stopping the program after the generation to allow the user to copy.

# Os

Used for:

Clearing the screen

&

Deleting the file at the end of the output, to get ready for next activation & space

# Thanks for reading this, i guess. kinda a failed project.
